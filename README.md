# BikeDataAnalysis
This project is a sample of doing big data analysis with java. 

I use the Indego Bike Share Data on bike rentals and trips in Philadelphia. You can download the datasets and read more about what’s available here https://www.rideindego.com/about/data/. 

The project is responsible to answer the following 10 questions:
1. How many Walk-Up trips were there in 2016?

2. How many stations that had a Go-Live Date in 2015 are still Active?

3. What percentage of trips started in Rittenhouse Square?

4. What percentage of trips made by Indego30 riders are round trips?

5. What is the ID of the bike that has traveled the most in terms of duration?

6. On 8/3/16 at 7:00am, how many bikes were being used?

7. Print all the trip information for the longest trip by distance. I’ll assume that the latitude and longitude are points in 2-D space and use Euclidean distance.

8. Print the list of trip ids of all trips that involved a station which was the only station to go live on its respective go-live date.

9. Stations can be located using the longitude and latitude coordinates provided in the dataset. We can define “closeness” as follows: Two stations are considered close to each other if the average difference between their longitudes and latitudes, i.e., (difference longitude + difference latitude) / 2, is less than 0.02 points. Find all pairs of stations that are considered close to each other.

10. What is the least popular end station?
